                                              Employee Management System

This C++ program is an Employee Management System that allows the user to manage different types of employees within a company.

                                                       Overview


The system defines three types of employees:

Employee: Represents a basic employee with information like name, number, date of joining, salary, and experience.
Manager: Derived from Employee, adds additional attributes such as title and payment.
Scientist: Derived from Employee, includes a publication count.
The program interacts with the user through the console, allowing input of employee data, displaying employee details, and demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism concepts.

                                                         Usage

Compile: Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run: Execute the compiled program.
Input: Follow the prompts to input employee data such as name, number, date of joining, salary, etc.
Output: The program displays employee details, including name, number, date of joining, experience, salary, etc.


                                                        Features


Creation and management of employees with different roles.
Ability to view employee details, including private information (demonstrated in the client function).
Demonstration of inheritance and polymorphism using derived classes.


                                                         Classes


Employee: Base class defining basic employee attributes and functionalities.
Manager: Derived class inheriting from Employee, includes manager-specific attributes.
Scientist: Derived class inheriting from Employee, includes scientist-specific attributes.


                                                     File Operations


The program writes employee data to a file named "employees.txt" for future reference.


                                                 Additional Information


The program demonstrates operator overloading for comparison (==) between employees.
Memory management: Uses dynamic memory allocation (new[] and delete[] for arrays).
Instructions
Compilation: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.
Execution: Run the compiled program.
Follow Prompts: Input employee data as prompted.
View Output: Check the console output for employee details.


Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific requirements or extend its functionalities.
